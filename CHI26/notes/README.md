# CHI 2026 — Reading Notes

> This folder is managed by the [CHI'26 Reading List](https://thaxali.github.io/HCI/CHI26/) UI.

Notes are stored as individual markdown files per paper (`paper-01.md`, `paper-02.md`, etc.) and can be read/written by Claude through its GitHub connection.

## How it works

1. The reading list UI saves notes to GitHub via the Contents API
2. Each paper gets its own markdown file with status, rating, relevance, and timestamped notes
3. Claude can read these files to understand your reading progress and insights
4. Claude can also write to these files to add analysis or suggestions

## Asking Claude about your reading

You can ask Claude things like:
- "Read my notes for paper 3 and suggest connections to other papers"
- "What patterns do you see across my reading notes?"
- "Add a summary to paper-05.md based on the PDF"
- "Which papers haven't I read yet that relate to my notes on behavioral sensing?"
