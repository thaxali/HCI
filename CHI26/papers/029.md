**Title:** What Exactly Are AI Companies Trying to Build? Here's a Guide.
**Authors:** New York Times Technology section
**Source:** The New York Times — September 16, 2025
**One-liner:** A plain-English breakdown of the six competing visions driving the AI investment boom — from better search to artificial general intelligence — and why profitability remains stubbornly elusive across all of them.

## TL;DR — Why You Should Care

If you have ever tried to explain what "AI companies are actually doing" to someone outside the industry, you know how hard that question is to answer cleanly. The AI boom has produced an almost comical variety of things being built — chatbots, drug discovery platforms, autonomous weapons systems, AI friends, voice assistants, coding tools — and none of the standard descriptions quite capture the full picture. This NYT piece is one of the better attempts to map the territory. It identifies six distinct visions that different companies are pursuing, explains the economic logic (and illogic) behind each, and is honest about the fact that most of them are not yet profitable.

The numbers in this piece are worth sitting with. **Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI plan to spend more than three hundred twenty-five billion dollars combined on data centers in 2025** — that is one hundred billion dollars more than the annual budget of Belgium. OpenAI charges twenty dollars per month for ChatGPT, and according to the company, that subscription price at least covers the cost of delivering it — but **paying subscribers account for fewer than six percent of ChatGPT users**. The free version is still losing money. Eight in ten businesses have started using generative AI, but just as many report "no significant bottom-line impact," according to McKinsey. The gap between investment and returns is staggering, and the article does not pretend otherwise.

## The Core Argument

The article maps six visions. First: better search engines. Companies are building chatbots that give you a plain English answer instead of a list of blue links. The problem is that search works as a business because of advertising — users click links, advertisers pay for clicks, money flows. A chatbot that just answers your question removes the click. The economic model for AI search has not been solved. Second: workplace productivity tools. AI for writing code, summarizing meetings, drafting emails, and running software applications. This is the most commercially promising near-term vision and the most aggressively sold to enterprise customers. The challenge is that "impressive demo" to "real productivity gain" is a long road.

Third: universal digital assistants embedded everywhere — in glasses, phones, voice devices, cars. Meta is adding AI to smart glasses for real-time translation and landmark identification. Amazon wants Alexa to be everything. The problem is that **Alexa has been around for a decade and has never been profitable**. Making a great assistant and making money from it are different problems. Fourth: AI companions — virtual friends, emotional support bots, relationship simulations. Character AI, Meta's social platform integrations, and others are building this. It exists, people use it, and it is generating controversy about whether it helps isolated people connect or whether it substitutes for real human relationships in harmful ways. Fifth: scientific breakthroughs. Google's AlphaFold has already delivered a Nobel Prize in Chemistry by predicting protein structures. Anthropic's CEO claims AI will solve cancer and poverty within years. Sixth: artificial general intelligence — human-level AI — the endgame that no one can clearly define but that almost everyone is racing toward.

## Key Insights and Evaluation

The article's most useful insight is about the attention economy angle. If you use a digital assistant embedded in your phone or glasses or home speaker, the company behind that assistant gets more access to your attention, your behavior, and ultimately your purchasing decisions than any website ever did. A search engine shows you links. A digital assistant has a conversation with you. That conversation is vastly more valuable from an advertising and targeting standpoint. So the investment in AI assistants is not just a bet on productivity — it is a bet on **owning the interface through which people experience the internet**. Whoever controls the assistant controls the experience. That is why every major tech company is building one even though none of them are profitable yet.

A researcher at Hugging Face is quoted making a point that deserves to be highlighted: "The amount of money being spent is not proportionate to the money that's coming in." That is a remarkable thing to say about a technology receiving three hundred twenty-five billion dollars in investment in a single year. The article takes that tension seriously rather than dismissing it. The honest read is that the companies doing the spending believe — or need to believe — that the returns are coming, they are just lagged. The optimistic case is that the internet also burned cash for years before transforming the global economy. The pessimistic case is that this time might be different.

## Seena Labs Relevance

This article maps the landscape in which Seena operates, which makes it essential reading for positioning. Seena sits at the intersection of the workplace productivity vision (AI tools that help researchers do their jobs better) and something more specific: AI that helps companies understand their users rather than just process information faster. That distinction matters because most of the visions described in this article are about AI doing things. Seena is about AI understanding things — specifically, understanding the human beings behind the behavioral data. That is a harder and more differentiated position.

The McKinsey finding is directly relevant to Seena's pitch. **Eight in ten businesses have adopted generative AI, but just as many report no significant bottom-line impact.** That gap exists because most businesses are using AI to do their existing work faster, not to do fundamentally better work. Seena's bet is that the real value is not in faster research — it is in deeper research. Not in summarizing what you already have — but in surfacing what you did not know to ask. That is the antidote to "research slop" and it is also the answer to why companies are spending on AI but not seeing returns: they are automating the wrong layer. **Speed is not the constraint on good product decisions. Understanding is.**

The AI companions section is also worth flagging for Brain Space. The question of whether AI relationships help or harm people is one that touches on mental health, social connection, and the design of human-AI interaction. Brain Space is building in adjacent territory — an AI that supports cognitive health and mental performance. The ethical and design questions being raised about AI companions (does this substitute for human connection or supplement it? does it create dependency?) are questions Brain Space will face too. Knowing the landscape of how these questions are being asked publicly gives you vocabulary for answering them preemptively.

## Everything is Designed — Social Media Angle

Here is the dinner party version. Companies are spending three hundred twenty-five billion dollars this year on AI data centers. That number is hard to visualize, so try this: it is more than the GDP of most countries on Earth. And the honest answer to "what are they building?" is: six different bets on what the future of the internet looks like, none of which are profitable yet, one of which involves making AI your best friend, and one of which involves solving cancer. The wildest part is that all of these visions are being pursued simultaneously, by the same handful of companies, because nobody actually knows which one will win. The content hook: **"AI companies are spending more money than most countries have, on technology they admit is not yet profitable, to build something they cannot clearly define. And they might be right to."**
