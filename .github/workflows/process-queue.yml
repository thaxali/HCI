            Read queue.md and find all URLs under the "## Pending" section.

            For each pending URL:
            1. Fetch and read the article using WebFetch
            2. Follow the instructions in CLAUDE.md to add it to the reading list (CHI26/index.html)
            3. After successfully adding it, move the URL from "## Pending" to "## Processed" in queue.md, prefixed with the paper number: e.g., "- #27 https://example.com"

            Process URLs one at a time, committing after each one.
            Commit message format: "Add paper #{N}: {Short Title}"

            If a URL cannot be fetched, leave it in Pending and add a note: "- https://... (fetch failed — retry later)"
